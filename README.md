# Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) - TensorFlow

This repository contains tensorflow implementation of steerable pyramid version of Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) proposed in [1]. This is a replication of MATLAB version released by the authors of [1] which is available [HERE](http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/ifcvec_release.zip).

## Dependencies
1) Python (>=3.5)
2) Numpy (>=1.16)
3) Python Imaging Library (PIL) (>=6.0)
4) Tensorflow (>=2.0)

## Usage
A demo code is provided in test.py for testing purposes
